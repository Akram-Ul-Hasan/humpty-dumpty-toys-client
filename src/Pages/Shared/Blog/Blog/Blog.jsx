          1. What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and
          where should we store them on the client-side?
        </h2>
        <p>
          An access token and refresh token are commonly used in authentication
          and authorization systems. Here's a simple explanation of what they
          are, how they work, and where they should be stored on the
          client-side:
        </p>
        <p>Access Token:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            An access token is a credential that grants access to specific
            resources or services on a server.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is typically short-lived and expires after a certain period
            (e.g., 15 minutes or 1 hour).
          </li>
          <li>
            When a user logs in or authenticates, the server issues an access
            token to the client.
          </li>
          <li>
            The client includes the access token in subsequent requests to the
            server to access protected resources or perform authorized actions.
          </li>
          <li>
            The server validates the access token to ensure the client has the
            necessary permissions, and if valid, it processes the request.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Refresh Token:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A refresh token is a long-lived credential used to obtain a new
            access token after the current access token expires.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is typically issued alongside the access token during the
            authentication process.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unlike access tokens, refresh tokens have a longer lifespan (e.g.,
            days, weeks, or months).
          </li>
          <li>
            When an access token expires, the client uses the refresh token to
            request a new access token from the server.
          </li>
          <li>
            The server verifies the refresh token's validity and issues a new
            access token to the client if it is valid.
          </li>
          <li>
            Refresh tokens help prevent the need for the user to reauthenticate
            frequently, improving the user experience.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Storage on the client-side:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Access tokens should be stored securely on the client-side to
            prevent unauthorized access.
          </li>
          <li>
            One common approach is to store the access token in the client's
            browser memory or a JavaScript variable.
          </li>
          <li>
            However, this approach has limitations and vulnerabilities, as the
            token may be accessible to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or
            other malicious code.
          </li>
          <li>
            A more secure option is to store the access token in an HTTP-only
            cookie, which is less vulnerable to XSS attacks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Refresh tokens, being long-lived and more sensitive, should be
            stored securely, preferably in an HTTP-only cookie or another secure
            storage mechanism provided by the platform or framework you are
            using.
          </li>
          <li>
            Storing tokens in cookies helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized
            access from client-side JavaScript code.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It's important to follow security best practices when handling access
          tokens and refresh tokens, such as using HTTPS for secure
          communication, setting appropriate token expiration times,
          implementing token revocation mechanisms, and regularly rotating the
          tokens for enhanced security.

        <h2>2. Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?</h2>
        <p>
          SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two types
          of databases with differences in how they store and retrieve data.
        </p>
        <p>SQL databases:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use tables with rows and columns to store structured data.</li>
          <li>
            Have a fixed structure called a schema that defines the data types
            and relationships between tables.
          </li>
          <li>Use SQL, a language for querying and manipulating data.</li>
          <li>
            Are good for applications that require structured data and complex
            queries, like e-commerce or banking systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            Can be more challenging to scale for high traffic or large datasets.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>NoSQL databases:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Store data in a flexible and schema-less manner, allowing for more
            dynamic and unstructured data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Have different data models, such as key-value, document,
            column-family, or graph.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use query mechanisms specific to each data model (not always using
            SQL).
          </li>
          <li>
            Are suitable for applications with rapidly changing data, high
            scalability needs, and simplified data models.
          </li>
          <li>
            Can handle large amounts of data and high traffic more easily than
            SQL databases.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In simple terms, SQL databases are like organized spreadsheets, while
          NoSQL databases are more like flexible storage boxes. SQL databases
          are good for structured data and complex queries, while NoSQL
          databases are better for unstructured data and scalability. The choice
          depends on the specific needs of your application.

        <h2>3. What is express js? What is Nest JS?</h2>
        <p>
          Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It
          provides a minimalistic and flexible set of tools for building web
          applications and APIs. Express.js simplifies the process of handling
          HTTP requests, routing, and middleware integration, making it easier
          to develop server-side applications in JavaScript. It has a large
          ecosystem of plugins and middleware that extend its functionality,
          allowing developers to add features like authentication, session
          management, and error handling.
        </p>
        <p>
          NestJS, on the other hand, is a progressive and scalable framework for
          building efficient server-side applications. It is built on top of
          Express.js and utilizes TypeScript as its primary language. NestJS
          takes inspiration from Angular, adopting a modular and component-based
          architecture. It provides an opinionated structure for organizing code
          and encourages the use of decorators, dependency injection, and
          object-oriented programming principles. NestJS supports various
          features such as routing, middleware, validation, database
          integration, and more, making it suitable for building complex and
          scalable applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both Express.js and NestJS are widely used frameworks in the Node.js
          ecosystem, with Express.js being more lightweight and flexible, while
          NestJS provides a structured and opinionated approach for building
          server-side applications. The choice between them depends on the
          specific requirements of your project and your preference for
          simplicity or a more structured development approach.

        <h2>4. What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work?</h2>
        <p>
          MongoDB's aggregate is a feature that helps you process and analyze
          data in a MongoDB database. It works by creating a pipeline of
          operations to transform and summarize the data. Each operation is
          called a stage, and they are executed in sequence. The output of one
          stage becomes the input for the next stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use stages like $match to filter data, $group to group data
          and perform calculations, $sort to sort data, $project to choose
          specific fields, and $limit to restrict the number of results.
        </p>
        <p>
          By chaining these stages together, you can perform complex operations
          on your data and retrieve valuable insights.
